## How Our App Works
Doctors turn on Scriber when surveying patients for FHIR medical record data. Instead of having to multitask and record while listening to their patient, doctors can focus solely on the patient and let Scriber record the information and fill in the records. This saves time and manpower in the medical field. 

## Technology Used
